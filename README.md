# OMDB-React-App

A simple React web app that allows a user to search for movies, displaying the movie title, year of release, and poster image as search results.

On the top left of the app is a search bar for the user to enter their API key, so they can search for movies.

The search bar on the bottom of the app is used to enter search queries.
